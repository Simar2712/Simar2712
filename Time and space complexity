```
int main() {
    int i = 1, sum = 0, n;
    while (i <= n) {
        i = i + 1;
        sum = sum + i;
    }
}
```

Time Complexity:

- The while loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The number of iterations is directly proportional to the value of `n`.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:

- The code uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables `i`, `sum`, and `n`, regardless of the input size `n`.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), which means the space usage is constant.
